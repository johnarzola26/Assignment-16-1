<p>Beginning in 1970 John's Lawn Care has grown from its Canadian roots into an international network of locally owned and operated lawn care businesses, providing healthy lawn care services that produce lush green lawns for homeowners from across Canada, United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>While our services began with Weed Control, today Johnâ€™s Lawn Care healthy lawn care programs and services focus on a well balanced, high quality fertilization program first, which in turn produces the thickest, healthiest lawn possible. A well rooted, thick, lush, healthy lawn is the best defence against all potential pest problems. Working together with our customers, John's Lawn Care guarantees that by utilizing our complete lawn care program in combination with proper watering and mowing, you will have a healthier, better-looking lawn.</p>
